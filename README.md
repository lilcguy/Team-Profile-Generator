# Team-Profile-Generator
A tool to create profiles for team members based on the user's input.

## Description

The team profile generator is a tool for creating profiles for employees in a company. Through the use of Inquirer in the terminal, it walks the user through adding information to the profiles -- as many as they would like of any type they would like -- until they are satisfied, where they may then create an HTML file that contains all of the profiles. This project was an exercise in using objects in JavaScript, template literals, and Jest for creating tests of the functionality.

## Installation

## Usage
Screenshots are found in /assets/images.
